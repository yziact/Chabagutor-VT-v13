* Complete screen workflows (currently enough for a demo, not for production)
* Inventory: find a way to have a nice autofocus for quantity, still compatible
  with barcode scanner (Odoo disables the autofocus when using barcode, which
  makes sense)
* Put-away: handle packages
* Handle "multi-shuttle" put-away
* Create glue module for product_expiry
* Challenge the save + release buttons and workflow
